### About

This project was intended to be a bluetooth controller for raspberry pi however after dumping hours into this project... I could not get past the basic issue of connecting a react native app to the RPi.

nrf connect android app worked fine and the android phone itself and windows 10 desktop could connect to the RPi

anyway I'm going the AP route which will be able to host a web app making this app not needed for now
