Starts off the day with misery business damn

I'm developing against the ML Hat Cam guts mostly for the wired so I can keep it going for a while

But also no systemd service using the camera that I gotta turn on/off on the cameras

I'm kind of too tired/mentally spent to code right now so just jotting down ideas/conceptualizing

I will work on this tomorrow/during these next two days off

6:45 PM

Right now I'm unsure if the camera aperture can be changed on the module 3

Also thinking about spot focus... which is a location thing

I don't have a menu designed in mind yet but main things I'll hit are:

- bluetooth connectivity
- pi client

6:55 PM

This is so cool

I don't like the blue anymore... I made it with this blue gradient and it makes it look bad... idk I'm thinking orange on orange could be cool

Oh damn, orange is legit!

It's so crips omg... the photo doesn't do it justice

Yeah... I don't like how the camera is on the right side currently, my hand goes over it on accident

So it will be moved to the left when I get the V3 camera module... which will be sometime next week, sucks gotta wait

The gradient unfortunately is visible on this display so I'll just use a solid color
